# The Mind-Body Problem
The mind-body problem concerns the relationship between mental states and physical processes. Dualists, like Descartes, argue that the mind is distinct from the body. Materialists claim that consciousness arises from brain activity.

The debate touches psychology, neuroscience, and metaphysics. Contemporary theories explore physicalism, emergentism, and computational models of the mind.
