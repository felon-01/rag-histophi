# The Industrial Revolution
The Industrial Revolution (18th–19th centuries) marked a shift from agrarian economies to industrialized, mechanized production. Originating in Britain, it spread to Europe and North America.

Key innovations included the steam engine, spinning jenny, and mechanized factories. The revolution accelerated urbanization, created new social classes, and boosted global trade. However, it also brought harsh working conditions and environmental changes.

The Industrial Revolution fundamentally transformed economic structures and set the foundation for modern capitalism and technological progress.
