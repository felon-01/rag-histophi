# The French Revolution
The French Revolution (1789–1799) was a political and social upheaval that transformed France from an absolute monarchy into a republic. Economic hardship, inequality, and Enlightenment ideas fueled calls for reform.

The revolution began with the formation of the National Assembly, followed by the storming of the Bastille. Major reforms abolished feudal privileges and established the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen. Radicalization led to the Reign of Terror, during which thousands were executed under the Committee of Public Safety.

The revolution ended with Napoleon Bonaparte’s rise to power in 1799. Its ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity influenced revolutions and political movements across the world.
