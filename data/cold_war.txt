# The Cold War
The Cold War (1947–1991) was a geopolitical rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. It involved ideological conflict between capitalism and communism but avoided direct large-scale warfare.

Key events included the Berlin Blockade, Korean War, Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam War, and the arms race. Nuclear deterrence, espionage, and proxy conflicts defined the era.

The Cold War ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Its legacy continues to influence international relations and global security.
