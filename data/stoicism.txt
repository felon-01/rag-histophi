# Stoicism
Stoicism is a Hellenistic philosophical school founded in the 3rd century BCE by Zeno of Citium. It teaches that virtue, understood as the cultivation of wisdom and moral character, is the only true good. External events are beyond our control, but we can control our reactions to them.

Stoicism divides philosophy into logic, physics, and ethics. Its ethical teachings emphasize living in harmony with nature, practicing self-discipline, and recognizing the transience of external pleasures or hardships. The Stoic idea of differentiating between what is “in our control” and what is “not in our control” remains highly influential.

Important Stoics include Seneca, Epictetus, and the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. Their writings stress resilience, rationality, and emotional regulation. Stoics reject the idea that emotions must dominate behavior; instead, they advocate examining judgments that give rise to negative emotions.

In modern times, Stoicism influences cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and self-management practices in psychology. It remains a popular philosophy for dealing with stress, uncertainty, and adversity.
