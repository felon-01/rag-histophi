# Existentialism
Existentialsim is a modern philosophical movement that emphasizes individual freedom, subjective experience, and the search for meaning in an indifferent or absurd universe. Key figures include Søren Kierkegaard, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus.

Existentialists argue that humans are not defined by predetermined essences or roles. Instead, individuals create themselves through choices and actions. Sartre described this as “existence precedes essence.” With freedom comes responsibility and the burden of shaping one’s identity.

Themes explored in existentialism include anxiety, authenticity, isolation, death, and the absurd. Camus, for instance, argued that life has no inherent meaning, yet humans persist in seeking purpose. His concept of the “absurd” captures the clash between this desire and the universe’s silence.

Existentialist ideas have influenced psychology, literature, theology, and political theory. They remain central to contemporary debates about meaning, identity, and personal responsibility.
