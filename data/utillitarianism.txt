# Utilitarianism
Utilitarianism is an ethical theory developed by Jeremy Bentham and refined by John Stuart Mill. It argues that the right action is the one that maximizes overall happiness or well-being.

The theory evaluates actions based on consequences rather than intentions. Critics argue that utilitarianism can conflict with individual rights, but supporters claim it offers a rational and impartial framework for decision-making.

Utilitarianism influences economics, public policy, and moral debates involving cost-benefit analysis.
