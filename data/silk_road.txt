# The Silk Road
The Silk Road was a network of trade routes linking East Asia and the Mediterranean from around 200 BCE to 1400 CE. It facilitated the exchange of silk, spices, technologies, religions, and ideas.

Caravans crossed deserts, mountains, and cities like Samarkand and Chang’an. Buddhism spread from India to East Asia through these routes.

The Silk Road shaped economic, cultural, and diplomatic interactions across continents.
