# Buddhism
Buddhism is a philosophical and religious tradition founded in the 5th century BCE by Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha. It centers on understanding the nature of suffering and the path to liberation.

The core teachings are summarized in the Four Noble Truths: suffering exists; suffering has a cause; suffering can end; and the path to ending suffering is the Noble Eightfold Path. This path includes ethical conduct, mental discipline, and wisdom.

Buddhism emphasizes impermanence, non-self, and dependent origination. Meditation practices such as mindfulness and concentration aim to cultivate awareness and reduce attachment.

Over time, Buddhism developed into branches including Theravāda, Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna. It influenced philosophy, psychology, and cultural traditions across Asia.

Modern interest in Buddhism focuses on mindfulness, compassion, and mental well-being.
