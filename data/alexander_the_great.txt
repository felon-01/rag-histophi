# Alexander the Great
Alexander the Great (356–323 BCE) was the King of Macedonia who became one of history's most renowned military leaders by conquering the vast Persian Empire and extending his rule across three continents. He ascended to the throne in 336 BCE after the assassination of his father, Philip II, at the age of 20. Early in his reign, he secured control over Greece and prepared for his ambitious campaign against Persia.

Starting his campaign in 334 BCE, Alexander crossed into Asia Minor, winning key battles such as the Battle of the Granicus River and the Battle of Issus by 333 BCE. He conquered the coastal cities of Caria, Lycia, and Phrygia, and famously besieged Tyre in 332 BCE. That same year, he entered Egypt and founded the city of Alexandria, which would become a major center of culture and learning.

In 331 BCE, Alexander decisively defeated Persian King Darius III at the Battle of Gaugamela, leading to the fall of the Achaemenid Empire’s major cities—Babylon, Susa, and Persepolis—and securing his claim as the King of Asia. After Darius’s death in 330 BCE, Alexander expanded further east through Central Asia, crossing the Hindu Kush and the Indus River, and defeated local rulers such as King Porus at the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BCE.

Alexander sought to integrate his vast empire by adopting some Persian customs and encouraging marriages between his soldiers and local women. His reign saw the spread of Hellenistic culture across the conquered lands. However, his army eventually mutinied at the Hyphasis River, forcing Alexander to turn back.



After a challenging journey through Gedrosia, Alexander returned and planned new campaigns but died young in 323 BCE in Babylon at the age of 32. His empire fragmented soon after due to lack of a clear successor. Alexander’s military genius, extensive conquests, and cultural legacy left an indelible mark on history, shaping the course of the Hellenistic world.​

Siege of Tyre (January–July 332 BCE): A seven-month siege of the heavily fortified island city of Tyre in Phoenicia. Alexander’s forces built a causeway to reach the city and eventually breached it, securing control of the Eastern Mediterranean coast.

Siege of Gaza (November 332 BCE): After Tyre, Alexander captured Gaza, the gateway to Egypt, which resisted fiercely. The victory opened the way for his peaceful entry into Egypt.



Battle of Gaugamela (October 1, 331 BCE): Also known as the Battle of Arbela, it was Alexander’s decisive victory over Darius III’s much larger Persian army. This battle led to the fall of the Persian Empire and Alexander's control over Babylon, Susa, and Persepolis.

Battle of the Persian Gate (December 330 BCE): A Persian attempt to halt Alexander’s advance into the Persian heartland, it was fiercely defended but ultimately outflanked, allowing Alexander entry into Persepolis.

Battle of Hydaspes (May 326 BCE): Fought against King Porus on the banks of the Hydaspes River in present-day Punjab, India. Despite difficult terrain and monsoon conditions, Alexander won, impressing by his respect towards Porus, whom he reinstated as a regional ruler.

Mutiny at the Hyphasis River (326 BCE): Alexander's troops refused to march further east, weary from years of campaigning. This marked the easternmost expansion of his empire.

The Gedrosian Desert Crossing (325 BCE): A treacherous march through the harsh Gedrosian desert (modern-day southern Iran and Pakistan), resulting in significant losses due to starvation and dehydration.

Alexander's campaigns, spanning from 334 BCE to 325 BCE, demonstrate his strategic military prowess and ambition, bringing Greek culture deep into Asia and influencing the regions he conquered for centuries.
