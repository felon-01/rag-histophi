# Immanuel Kant
Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) was a German philosopher whose work reshaped epistemology, ethics, and metaphysics. His “Critique of Pure Reason” argued that while knowledge begins with experience, the mind plays an active role in shaping it.

In ethics, Kant proposed the “categorical imperative,” which states that moral actions must be guided by universal principles that apply to all rational beings. He emphasized duty, autonomy, and the intrinsic worth of individuals.

Kant’s work influenced modern moral theory, political philosophy, and theories of human rights.
