# World War II
World War II (1939–1945) was a global conflict involving major powers aligned into the Allies and the Axis. It began with Germany’s invasion of Poland, prompting Britain and France to declare war. The conflict rapidly expanded across Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Pacific.

Key events included the Battle of Britain, Operation Barbarossa, the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the Holocaust. Technological advancements such as radar, codebreaking, and aircraft carriers shaped military strategy. The war in Europe ended in May 1945 with Germany’s surrender after the fall of Berlin. The Pacific War concluded in August 1945 following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

World War II reshaped global politics. The United States and the Soviet Union emerged as superpowers, leading to the Cold War. The United Nations was founded to promote international cooperation and prevent future conflicts. The war also accelerated decolonization and changed borders worldwide.
