# Ancient Egypt
Ancient Egypt, one of the earliest civilizations, developed along the Nile River around 3100 BCE. Its society was structured around pharaohs, religious traditions, and monumental architecture.

The Egyptians built pyramids, temples, and tombs reflecting beliefs in the afterlife. Hieroglyphic writing and advances in mathematics and medicine contributed to their enduring legacy.

Egypt experienced periods of unity and foreign rule before becoming part of the Roman Empire in 30 BCE. Its cultural influence remains significant in archaeology and historical research.

Ancient Egypt was one of the world's earliest and most enduring civilizations, spanning millennia with distinct historical periods:

Predynastic Period (circa 4300–3000 BCE): Formation of early Egyptian culture, development of writing, and gradual unification of Upper and Lower Egypt.

Early Dynastic Period (circa 3000–2686 BCE): Egypt’s first dynasties and kings established centralized rule and created early royal tombs and iconography.

Old Kingdom (2686–2181 BCE): Often called the "Age of the Pyramids," including the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza and rise of strong, centralized pharaohs.

First Intermediate Period (2181–2055 BCE): A time of political fragmentation and decentralization after the Old Kingdom decline.

Middle Kingdom (2055–1650 BCE): A renaissance of art, literature, and centralized governance.

Second Intermediate Period (1650–1550 BCE): Marked by Hyksos invasion and rule over northern Egypt.

New Kingdom (1550–1070 BCE): Egypt’s imperial height with famous pharaohs such as Hatshepsut, Thutmose III, Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, and Ramses II; expansion through military conquest and great temple building.

Third Intermediate Period (1070–664 BCE): Political instability, division, and decline.

Late Period (664–332 BCE): Revival under native rulers like Psamtik I; eventual Persian conquest.

Ptolemaic Period (332–30 BCE): Following Alexander the Great’s conquest, the Ptolemaic dynasty ruled Egypt, blending Greek and Egyptian cultures.

Roman Period (30 BCE–395 CE): Egypt became a Roman province following Cleopatra VII’s reign and the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty.

Throughout its history, ancient Egypt was famed for monumental architecture like pyramids and temples, hieroglyphic writing, advances in medicine and mathematics, a complex religion with many gods, and sophisticated art and culture. Archaeological finds such as the Rosetta Stone continue to illuminate this civilization’s legacy to the modern world.​
