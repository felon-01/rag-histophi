# Plato
Plato (428/427–348/347 BCE) was a foundational figure in Western philosophy and a student of Socrates. He is best known for his dialogues, in which philosophical ideas are explored through conversations. After Socrates’ execution, Plato founded the Academy in Athens, considered the first institution of higher learning in the Western world.

Plato developed a theory of Forms, proposing that reality is divided into two worlds: the imperfect physical world and the perfect, unchanging world of Forms or Ideas. For example, physical objects may vary, but the Form of “Beauty” or “Justice” exists as a pure concept. This theory influenced centuries of metaphysics.

In political philosophy, Plato’s “Republic” remains his most influential work. He argues that a just society is ruled by philosopher-kings—individuals trained for decades to understand truth and govern without corruption. The Republic also includes the famous “Allegory of the Cave,” illustrating how humans mistake sensory experience for true knowledge.

Plato contributed significantly to ethics, arguing that virtue is tied to knowledge; to know the good is to act accordingly. His ideas shaped later thinkers such as Aristotle, Plotinus, and medieval Christian philosophers.

Plato’s influence persists in contemporary discussions on morality, politics, reality, and the nature of the mind.
