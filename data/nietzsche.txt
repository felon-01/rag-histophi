# Nietzsche
Friedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900) was a German philosopher known for his critique of traditional morality, religion, and Western metaphysics. His writing style is aphoristic and provocative, aiming to challenge accepted beliefs.

Nietzsche’s concept of the “will to power” describes a fundamental drive for growth, strength, and self-overcoming. He famously declared “God is dead,” reflecting the decline of religious authority in modern society. Yet he also saw this as an opportunity for creating new values.

Nietzsche’s idea of the “Übermensch” encourages individuals to transcend societal norms and create their own moral frameworks. His doctrine of “eternal recurrence” asks individuals to evaluate whether they would willingly relive their lives infinitely.

Nietzsche’s influence spans literature, psychology, political theory, and existentialism. Despite misinterpretations of his work, his central themes involve self-creation, authenticity, and the transformation of values.
