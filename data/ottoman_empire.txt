# The Ottoman Empire
The Ottoman Empire (1299–1922) was a major Islamic empire centered in Anatolia and southeast Europe. At its height under Suleiman the Magnificent, it controlled territories across three continents.

The empire integrated diverse cultures and religions through the millet system. Its military innovations, architecture, and administrative structures were highly influential.

Internal challenges, nationalism, and conflict with European powers contributed to its decline. After World War I, the empire dissolved, giving rise to modern Turkey.
