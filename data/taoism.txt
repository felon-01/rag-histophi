# Taoism
Taoism is a Chinese philosophical and religious tradition emphasizing harmony with the Tao, the natural order of the universe. It is associated with the writings of Laozi and the “Tao Te Ching.”

Taoism teaches that the Tao is ineffable and cannot be fully described. Instead, individuals should cultivate effortless action, or “wu wei,” allowing events to unfold naturally. This contrasts with forceful or overly structured behavior.

Yin and yang symbolize complementary forces in nature—balance rather than opposition. Taoism encourages simplicity, humility, and flexibility.

Its influence appears in Chinese medicine, martial arts, poetry, and aesthetics. Taoist ideas remain relevant in discussions of sustainability, minimalism, and mental calm.
