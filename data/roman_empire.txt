# The Roman Empire
The Roman Empire, founded in 27 BCE, became one of history’s most influential civilizations. It spanned Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East at its height.

Roman governance combined centralized authority with local autonomy. Its legal system influenced modern law, while Roman engineering achievements—roads, aqueducts, and architecture—shaped urban development.

The empire eventually split into Western and Eastern halves. The Western Roman Empire fell in 476 CE, while the Eastern, known as the Byzantine Empire, persisted for nearly a thousand more years. Roman culture, language, and institutions continue to shape Western civilization.
